            In this second part, <b>you will observe the outcome of other participants' choices</b> in the previous task.
            The options they faced were drawn from the same distribution as yours in the first part.
            Just like you, these participants could have cooperated between 0 and {{ C.number_of_trials }} times,
            across the {{ C.number_of_trials }} rounds.
            Just knowing how many times they chose to cooperate,
            we want to know how cooperative you think that participant is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, you will be shown the number of times one of our participants chose the cooperative option,
            out of the {{ C.number_of_trials }} rounds, and asked to evaluate how cooperative they are.
            For instance, if a participant chose to the cooperative option for half the rounds, you will see
            <span class="fraction-inline">
              <span class="diagonal-line"></span>
              <span class="k-value">10</span>
              <span class="denominator">{{ C.number_of_trials }}</span>
            </span>.
            If they chose the cooperative option on all rounds, you will see
            <span class="fraction-inline">
              <span class="diagonal-line"></span>
              <span class="k-value">20</span>
              <span class="denominator">{{ C.number_of_trials }}</span>
            </span>.
            And if they chose the cooperative option on all rounds but one, you will see
            <span class="fraction-inline">
              <span class="diagonal-line"></span>
              <span class="k-value">19</span>
              <span class="denominator">{{ C.number_of_trials }}</span>
            </span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will see this proportion of cooperative choices <b>for {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} different participants,
            one per page</b>.
            So, on each page, you will see the number of times a person chose the cooperative option,
            and use a slider to rate, out of 100, how cooperative you think they are.
        </p>
        <p>
            To motivate you to think carefully about your ratings,
            <b>you can earn a <u>bonus of {{ C.bonus_ratings }}</u>,
            depending on how far your guess is from the average guess of other participants.</b>
            If you are closer than <b>{{ C.percent_accurate }}%</b> of all the other participants,
            you will receive the bonus.
            Only one of the {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} ratings will be randomly selected for that,
            so you should think carefully about each individual rating.
        </p>
        <p> {{ if player_id == 'odd' }}
            But first,
            {{ endif }}
            {{ if player_id == 'even' }}
            After that,
            {{ endif }}
            we will also ask you to estimate the amount of participants
            who chose the cooperative option fo each possible proportion.
            For each possible number of cooperative choices (0/20, 1/20, …, 20/20),
            we ask you to estimate how many participants out of 100 chose the cooperative options that number of times.
            You will get a {{ C.bonus_fraction}} bonus for each of your guesses that is within 1% of the correct number.
