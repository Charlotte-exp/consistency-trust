            In this second part, <b>you will observe the outcome of other participants' choices</b> in the previous task.
            For each other participant, you will be shown the number of times they chose the cooperative option out of the 20 rounds.
            The options they faced were drawn from the same distribution as yours in the first part.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, if a participant chose to the cooperative option for half the rounds, you will see
            <span class="fraction-inline">
              <span class="diagonal-line"></span>
              <span class="k-value">10</span>
              <span class="denominator">20</span>
            </span>.
            If they chose the cooperative option on all rounds, you will see
            <span class="fraction-inline">
              <span class="diagonal-line"></span>
              <span class="k-value">20</span>
              <span class="denominator">20</span>
            </span>.
            And if they chose the cooperative option on all rounds but one, you will see
            <span class="fraction-inline">
              <span class="diagonal-line"></span>
              <span class="k-value">19</span>
              <span class="denominator">20</span>
            </span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will see this proportion of cooperative choices <b>for 10 different participants, one per page</b>.
            Based on each proportion, we will ask you <b>how cooperative you think the participant was</b> overall.
            So, on each page, you will see the number of times a person chose the cooperative option,
            and use a slider to rate, out of 100, how cooperative you think they are.
        </p>
        <p>
            To motivate you to think carefully about your ratings, <b>you will earn a <u>bonus of {{ C.bonus }}</u>
            if your rating is within {{ C.percent_accurate }}%
            of the average ratings</b> others in this study gave to that person.
            Only one of the 10 rating will be randomly selected for that,
            so you should think carefully about each individual rating.
