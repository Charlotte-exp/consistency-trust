        Now, you will observe the outcome of other participants' choices.
        You will see the number of times another participant chose the cooperative option out of the 20 trials.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if a participant chose to the cooperative option for half the trials, you will see 10/20.
        If they cooperated on all trials, you will see 20/20.
        And if they cooperated on all trials but one, you will see 19/20.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will this proportion of cooperative choices for 10 different participants, one per page.
        Based on each proportion, we will ask you how cooperative you think the participant was overall.
        So on each page, you will see the number of times a person chose the cooperative option,
        and use a slider to rate out of 100 how cooperative you think they are.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your rating is within {{ C.percent_accurate }}%
        of the average ratings others in this study gave to that person,
        you will earn a bonus of {{ C.bonus }}
