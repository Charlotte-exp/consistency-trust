    <p>
        In this part of the study,
        we want to ask you about your best guess regarding the people who participated in the first part of the study.
        This will come in two sections.
        Just like you, these participants could have cooperated between 0 and {{ C.number_of_trials }} times,
        across the {{ C.number_of_trials }} rounds, and
        the options they faced were drawn from the same distribution as yours in the first part.

    </p>

    <h6>We will start with the first section.</h6>
