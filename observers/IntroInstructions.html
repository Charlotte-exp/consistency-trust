        In addition to yourself, several other people participated in this same study.
        Just like you, these other participants faced {{ C.number_of_trials }} choices about whether to cooperate,
        with similar monetary amounts offered.
        In parts 2 and 3, we would like you to make guesses both about how those other participants may have acted,
        and we would like you to make some inferences about those participants based on how they may have acted
        (We will randomly determine which part you see first.).

    <h6>We will start with Part 2.</h6>
