        When you press the randomiser button, one round out of the {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} above will be randomly selected.
        The option you chose on that round is the one you will receive.
    </p>
    <p>
        If one of the cooperative/selfish rounds is selected,
        the option you chose on that round is the one you and the previous participant will receive as bonus payment.
        If one of the risky/safe rounds is selected,
        and you selected the risky option in that round,
        the computer will automatically randomly determine whether you get the specified bonus based on the specified probability.
