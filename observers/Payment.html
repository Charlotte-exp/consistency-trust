        Once all participants are done with the study, you will receive your bonus through Prolific.
        The final amount is a combination of the bonuses just randomly selected from your decision in the first task,
        one randomly selected from the next participant's decisions, where applicable,
        and the bonus of the 2nd task if it falls within {{ C.percent_accurate }} % the study average.
        This can take a couple of weeks.
