        Once all participants are done with the study, you will receive your bonus through Prolific.
        The final amount is a combination of the bonus randomly selected from your decision in the first part,
        and once the data is compiled, the bonuses from part 2 and 3, when applicable.
        This can take a couple of weeks.
