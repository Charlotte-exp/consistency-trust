    <p>
        This is a short experiment in decision-making.
        In this experiment you will be matched with another participant from Prolific.
        Neither of you will ever know the identity of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two possible bonuses are available to you and your counterpart in the experiment.
        The bonuses depend on the option chosen by you.
        We showed the two payment options to your counterpart.
        The only information you will have is the message your counterpart sends to you.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="card bg-light instructions">
    <div  class="card-body">
        <p>
        Two possible messages could be sent:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Message 1: “Option A will earn you more money than option B.”
        </li>
        <li>
            Message 2: “Option B will earn you more money than option A.”
        </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        Once you have the message, it is your turn to choose either option A or option B.
        Your choice will determine the bonuses of both of you in the experiment.
        You will never know what sums were actually offered in the option not chosen
        (that is, if the message sent by your counterpart was true or not).
        Moreover, you will never know the sums your counterpart could be paid with the other option.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        After you press the "Next" button,
        you will be redirected to a waitroom to be paired with another player who will send you the message
        Once you are paired, the task will start immediately.
