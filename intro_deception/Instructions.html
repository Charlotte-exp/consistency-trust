    <p>
        There are two players in this task: a <b>Sender</b> and a <b>Receiver</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The task is a choice between two options: A and B.
        The options determine a bonus each for the Sender and the Receiver.
        The option chosen dictates which bonus both players get.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Receiver makes the choice, but they do not know the bonuses from the options.
        The Sender does not make the choice, but they do know the bonuses from the options.
    </p>
        The task is made of two steps.
        First, the Sender has the opportunity to send a message to the Receiver recommending one option over the other.
        Then the Receiver sees that message and can chose one of the two options.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Receiver is free to chose whichever option they wish, regardless of what the message is.
        Whether the Receiver follows the message or not has no impact on the bonus of either player.
        The amounts from the option chosen by the Receiver are the bonus that both will receive.
        They are not necessarily the same for each player.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        The task is repeated three times, each time with a different partner.
        The role of all participants is fixed across all three repetitions.
        The new partner does not know what happened in the previous repetition(s).
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that Senders will send a message three times, each to a different Receiver.
        And Receiver will make three different choices, each about a different Sender.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bonuses are accumulated over the three repetitions and summed up.
        The total amount will be paid as one bonus at the end of the experiment.
    </p>

            For all three repetitions of the task, you have been assigned the role of: <b>{{ player.role }}</b>
        </p>

        {{ if player.role == C.RECEIVER_ROLE }}
        <p>
            You are the one choosing between option A and option B.
            Before you do so, you will receive a message from the Sender who themselves know what the bonuses attached to each option are.
        </p>
        <p>
            The message you receive will be either of:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Option A will earn you a bigger bonus that Option B.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Option B will earn you a bigger bonus that Option A.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            You will never know what bonuses were actually offered in the option not chosen
            (that is, if the message sent by the Sender was true or not).
            Moreover, you will never know the bonus the Sender could have earned with the other option.
            The message is not binding: in the end, it only depends on your choice.
            Your choice will decide both yours and the Sender's bonus.
        </p>
        {{ else }}
        <p>
            You are the one who knows what the bonuses from each option are.
            You have a choice between two messages to send to the Receiver to influence their choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            The message you send can be either of:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Option A will earn you a bigger bonus that Option B.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Option B will earn you a bigger bonus that Option A.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Receiver can choose whether or not to use this information when deciding which option to pick.
            Their decision will determine both of your bonuses, regardless of whether or not they followed your suggestion.
            However, the Receiver will never know what bonuses were actually offered in the option not chosen
            (that is,they will never know whether your message was true or not).
            Moreover, they will never know the bonuses that you could have earned according to the different options.

        After you press the "Next" button,
        you will be redirected to a waitroom to be paired with another player who will be the

        Once you are paired, the task will start immediately.
