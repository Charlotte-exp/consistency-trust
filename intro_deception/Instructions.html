        There are two players in this task: a <b>Sender</b> and a <b>Receiver</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bonus you both receive depends on which box out of two options the receiver chooses.
        The receiver has no information about the payoffs in boxes.
        However, the Sender does know the contents of each box.
        Before the receiver makes their choice, the Sender has the opportunity to recommend one box to the receiver.
        The Receiver is free to make whatever choice they wish, regardless of the message.
    </p>
    <p>
        The payoffs inside the box chosen by the receiver are the bonus that both of you will receive.
        They are not necessarily the same for each player.
