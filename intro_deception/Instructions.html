    <p>
        There are two players in this task: a <b>Sender</b> and a <b>Receiver</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The task is a choice between two options: A and B.
        The options determine a bonus each for the Sender and the Receiver.
        The option chosen dictates which bonus both players get.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Receiver makes the choice, but they do not know the bonuses from the options.
        The Sender does not make the choice, but they do know the bonuses from the options.
    </p>
        The task is made of two steps.
        First, the Sender has the opportunity to send a message to the Receiver recommending one option over the other.
        Then the Receiver sees that message and can chose one of the two options.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Receiver is free to chose whichever option they wish, regardless of what the message is.
        Whether the Receiver follows the message or not has no impact on the bonus of either player.
        The amounts from the option chosen by the Receiver are the bonus that both will receive.
        They are not necessarily the same for each player.
    </p>

            In this task, you have been assigned the role of: <b>{{ player.role }}</b>
        </p>

        {{ if player.role == C.RECEIVER_ROLE }}
        <p>
            You are the one choosing between option A and option B.
            Before you make your choice, you will get a suggestion from the Sender.
            This suggestion is not binding: in the end, it only depends on your choice.
            Your choice will decide both yours and the Sender's bonus.
        </p>
        {{ else }}
        <p>
            You are the one who knows what the bonuses from each option are.
            You have to send a message to the Receiver suggesting that they open either option A or option B.
            The Receiver can choose whether or not to use this information when deciding which option to pick.
            Their decision will determine both of your bonuses, regardless of whether or not they followed your suggestion.

        After you press the "Next" button,
        you will be redirected to a waitroom to be paired with another player who will be the
        {{ if player.role == C.RECEIVER_ROLE }} Sender {{ else }} Receiver{{ endif }}.
        Once you are paired, the task will start immediately.
