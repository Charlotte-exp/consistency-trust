        This is a short experiment in decision-making.
        In this experiment you will be matched with another participant from Prolific.
        Neither of you will ever know the identity of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two possible bonuses are available to you and your counterpart in the experiment.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="card bg-light instructions">
    <div  class="card-body">
        <p>
        The two payment options are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Option A: $5 to you and $6 to the other student
        </li>
        <li>
            Option B: $6 to you and $5 to the other student
        </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        The choice rests with the other student who will have to choose either option A or option B.
        The only information your counterpart will have is information sent by you in a message.
        That is, he or she will not know the monetary payments associated with each choice.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-light instructions">
    <div  class="card-body">
        <p>
        These are the two possible messages, which you can send to your counterpart:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Message 1: “Option A will earn you more money than option B.”
        </li>
        <li>
            Message 2: “Option B will earn you more money than option A.”
        </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        We will show the other student your message, and ask him or her to choose either A or B.
        To repeat, your counterpart’s choice will determine the bonuses in the experiment.
        However, your counterpart will never know what sums were actually offered in the option not chosen
        (that is, he or she will never know whether your message was true or not).
        Moreover, he or she will never know the sums to be paid to you according to the different options.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will pay the bonus to the two of you according to the choice made by your counterpart.
    </p>
</div>

<p></p>

<div>
    <p>
        After you press the "Next" button,
        you will be redirected to a waitroom to be paired with another player who you will send the message to.
        Once you are paired, the task will start immediately.
    </p>
</div>

    <p>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-end">
        {% next_button %}
        </div>
    </p>
