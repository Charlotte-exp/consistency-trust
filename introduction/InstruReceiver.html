        You are the <b>Receiver</b>. This means that you have <b>no</b> decision to make in any interaction.
        You will know the amount of tokens you earned in each interaction, but not who made the decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        DO I explain all the payoffs and stuff??
        DO I ask them what they think the other player will do? like to fight boredom... they might actually quit easily the receivers...
        You and the other player are each given {{ Constants.endowment_p1 }}. In each round, Participant 1, but not participant 2,
        can decide to take the tokens of Participants 2. Participant 2 will be left with nothing.
