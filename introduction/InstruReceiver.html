        You are Participant 2. This means that you have <b>no</b> decision to take.
        You will be paired randomly with a different participant 1 in each round of the task.

    <p>
        You and the other player are each given {{ Constants.endowment_p1 }} tokens. In each round, Participant 1, but not participant 2,
