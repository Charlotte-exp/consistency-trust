        You are the <b>Decider</b>. This means that in every interaction you have a decision to make.
        In each interaction, both you and the receiver are allocated with {{Constants.endowment_p1}} each.
        You have to decide if you want to take the tokens of the receiver or leave them. If you take them,
        you will earn {{Constants.pot_money}} in that interaction where you made that choice and the receiver gets nothing.
        If you decide to leave it, you keep your allocated {{Constants.endowment_p1}} and so does the receiver.
        The receiver will know his final amount, but not who decided.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember, in each interaction you are paired up with someone different.
        What happened previously is in the past and you are allocated {{Constants.endowment_p1}} again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below you can see what your choices in each interaction will be.
