    <p>
        For this experiment, you have been randomly assigned the role of <b>Decider</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that in every interaction you have a decision to make.
        In each interaction, both you and the receiver are allocated with <b>{{half_pot}}</b> each.
        You have the opportunity to take the money of the receiver or leave it. If you decide to take it,
        you will earn <b>{{pot_money}}</b> in that interaction and the receiver gets nothing.
        If you decide to leave it, you keep your allocated <b>{{half_pot}}</b> and so does the receiver.
        Receivers will only learn their overall earnings (across all the receiver's interactions), but not the individual decisions of each decider.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember, in each interaction you are paired up with someone different and make a new decision.
        What happened previously is in the past and you are allocated {{half_pot}} again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below you can see what your choices in each interaction will look like.
