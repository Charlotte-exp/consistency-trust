        For this experiment, you have been randomly assigned the role of <b>Decider</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that you will have a decision to make.
        In an interaction, both you and the recipient are allocated an equal endowment each.
        The amount can can range from £0.10 to £1 each. Any amount can happen with equal probability.
        <p></p>
        You have the opportunity to take the money of the recipient or to leave it. If you decide to take it,
        you will earn both endowment for yourself and the recipient will get nothing.
        If you decide to leave it, you keep your allocated endowment and so does the recipient.
        Recipients will only learn the amount they earned, but not what the decision was or who decided.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below you can see what your choice in the task will look like if the endowment is £1 each.
