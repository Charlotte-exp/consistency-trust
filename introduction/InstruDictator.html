    <p>
        For this experiment, you have been randomly assigned the role of <b>Decider</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This means that in every interaction you have a decision to make.
        In each interaction, both you and the recipient are allocated an equal endowment each.
        The amount can can range from 0.10GBP TO 1GBP EACH. Each of amount can happen with equal probability.
        <p></p>
        You have the opportunity to take the money of the recipient or leave it. If you decide to take it,
        you will earn both endowment for yourself in that interaction and the recipient gets nothing.
        If you decide to leave it, you keep your allocated endowment and so does the recipient.
        Recipients will only learn their overall earnings (across all the recipient's interactions),
        but not the individual decisions of each decider.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember, in each interaction you are paired up with someone different and make a new decision.
        What happened previously is in the past and both you and the recipient are allocated a new endowment again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below you can see what your choices in each interaction will look like if the endowment is 1GBP each.
