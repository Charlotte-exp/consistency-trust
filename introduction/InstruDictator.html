        Now we will describe how each interaction works.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the beginning of each interaction,
        both the <b>active player</b> and the <b>passive player</b> are allocated an endowment.
        Both players' endowments will either be {{ Constants.low_half_pot }} or {{ Constants.high_half_pot }}.
        The size of the endowment is random and might differ between interactions
        but it will always be the same for the two players.
    </p>
    <p>
        After receiving endowments, the <b>active player</b> makes the following decision: he/she can leave the endowments as is or take the <b>passive player's</b> endowment.
        If the <b>active player</b> decides to leave them as is, both players receive their endowment.
        If the <b>active player</b> decides to take the other player's endowment,
        he/she will receive both endowments and the <b>passive player</b> will get nothing from this interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below you can see what the <b>active player's</b> decision will look like if the endowment is <b>{{ Constants.low_half_pot }}</b> in this interaction.
    </p>

        Interaction {{ subsession.round_number }}
    </h5>
    <p>
        Both you and the other player have been endowed with <b>{{ Constants.low_half_pot }}</b> each.
        You have the opportunity to take the money from the other player, or to leave it.
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you take it, your total payoff for this interaction will be <b>{{ Constants.low_pot_money }}</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you leave it, your total payoff for this interaction will be <b>{{ Constants.low_half_pot }}</b>.
            </li>
        </ul>
