        This means that will have a decision to make.
        In this task, both you and the recipient are allocated an equal endowment each.
        The amount can can range from £0.10 to £1 each. Any amount can happen with equal probability.
        <p></p>
        You have the opportunity to take the money of the recipient or leave it. If you decide to take it,
        you will earn both endowment for yourself in that interaction and the recipient gets nothing.
        If you decide to leave it, you keep your allocated endowment and so does the recipient.
        Recipients will only learn the the outcome of the decision, but not who decided.
