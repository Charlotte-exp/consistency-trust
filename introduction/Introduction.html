        You will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant.
        In this study, one of you will be Participant 1 and the other
        Participant 2. Prior to making a decision, you will learn your role,
        which will be randomly assigned at the beginning of the task, but then fixed for the rest of the study.
    </p>
    <p>
        You and the other player are each given {{ Constants.endowment_p1 }} tokens. In each round, Participant 1, but not participant 2,
        can decide to take the tokens of Participants 2. Participant 2 will be left with nothing.
