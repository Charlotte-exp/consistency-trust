        <p><b>Thank you for taking part in this study!</b></p>

    <p>
        In this study, you are about to engage in <b>a task with multiple participants</b> who are also taking part in the same session as you.
        You will be interacting in real time with these participants.
        The task consists of many interactive rounds; in each round you will be playing with a new participant.
        Your bonus payment will depend on the decisions made by either you or the participants in this task.
    </p>
    <p>
        During this study, you will accumulate tokens. In each rounds, your tokens will be worth different amounts in GBP.
        At the end of the study, all the tokens you have earned will be converted to GBP using the different rates
        you received for each round and paid as a bonus after completing the study.
        You must stay on task at all times. Otherwise you will automatically be disconnected and lose your bonus.
