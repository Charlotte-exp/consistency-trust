        <p><b>Thank you for taking part in this study!</b></p>

    <p>
        In this study, you are are going to engage in an interaction with another participant.
        Each participant is assigned a role. They can either be the <b>active player</b> or the <b>passive player</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the interaction, there is the opportunity for each player to receive a bonus payment.
        This bonus will depend only on a decision taken by the <b>active player</b>.
        The <b>passive player</b> will not make any decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        After this interaction, you might face any number of additional interactions.
        Each such interaction will work the same as the first one,
        except you will be paired with a new participant.
        Your role (<b>active player</b> or <b>passive player</b>) will remain the same.
        The bonuses from each interaction will be summed up and paid to you after you have completed the study.

    </p>

    <p>
        You must stay on task at all times. Otherwise you will automatically be disconnected and lose your bonus.
