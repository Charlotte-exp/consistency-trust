        <p><b>Thank you for taking part in this study!</b></p>

    <p>
        In this study, you are about to engage in <b>a task with multiple participants</b> who are also taking part in the same session as you.
        You will be interacting in real time with these participants.
        The task consists of many interactive rounds; in each round you will be playing with a new participant.
        Your bonus payment will depend on the decisions you and the other participants make in this task.
    </p>
    <p>
        During this study, you will accumulate tokens (pts).
        At the end of the study, all the tokens you have earned will be converted to GBP
        at a rate of {{ Constants.conversion }} and paid as a bonus after completing the study.
        You must stay on task at all times. Otherwise you will automatically be disconnected and lose your bonus.
