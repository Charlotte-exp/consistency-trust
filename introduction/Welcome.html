        <p><b>Thank you for taking part in this study!</b></p>

    <p>
        In this study, you are about to engage in {{ Constants.num_interactions}} interactions with a <b>different participant</b> in each.
        Every participant taking part in this study will be given the role of either <b>decider</b> or <b>receiver</b>.
        This role is fixed throughout the whole study. You will keep your assigned role in every interaction.
        In each interaction, one decider and one receiver are paired up. Only the decider, not the receiver, will have a decision to make.
    </p>
    <p>
        In each interaction, there is the opportunity to earn a bonus payment.
        Both the bonus of the decider and the receiver depend on the decisions of the decider.
        At the end of the study, all the bonus you have earned from every interaction will be summed up and paid to you after completing the study.
    </p>
    <p>
        You must stay on task at all times. Otherwise you will automatically be disconnected and lose your bonus.
