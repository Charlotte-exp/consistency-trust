        <p><b>Thank you for taking part in this study!</b></p>

    <p>
        In this study, you are about to engage in {{ Constants.n_of_rounds}} interactions with <b>multiple participants</b>.
        Every participant taking part in this study will be given the role of either <b>decider</b> or <b>receiver</b>.
        This role is fixed throughout the whole study. You will keep the same in every interaction.
        In each interaction, one decider and one receiver are paired up. Only the decider, not the receiver, will have a decision to make.
        Both bonuses of the decider and the receiver depend on that decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        In each interaction, there is the opportunity to earn a bonus payment.
        The exact amount is randomly assigned for each decider, and the ifnal bonus will depend on the choice of the decider.
        At the end of the study, all the bonus you have earned will be summed up and paid to you as a bonus after completing the study.
    </p>
    <p>
        You must stay on task at all times. Otherwise you will automatically be disconnected and lose your bonus.
