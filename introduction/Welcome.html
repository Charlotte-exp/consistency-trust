        in which case your assigned role will remain the same in every interaction.
        In the interaction, one decider and one recipient are paired up.
        Only the decider, but not the recipient, will have a decision to make.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the interaction, there is the opportunity to earn a bonus payment.
        Both the bonus of the decider and the recipient depend on the decisions of the decider.
        At the end of the study,
        all the bonus you have earned from every interaction will be summed up and paid to you after completing the study.
