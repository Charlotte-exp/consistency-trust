        <p><b>Thank you for taking part in this study!</b></p>

    <p>
        In this study, you are are going to engage in an interaction with another participant.
        Each participant is assigned a role. They can either be the <b>decider</b> or the <b>recipient</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the interaction, there is the opportunity to earn a bonus payment.
        Both the bonus of the decider and the recipient depend on a decision of the decider.
        Only the decider, but not the recipient, will make that decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        The interaction might be repeated.
        You would be paired up with a different participant each time,
        and your assigned role will remain the same in every interaction.
        At the end of the study,
        all the bonus you have earned from every possible interaction will be summed up and paid to you after completing the study.
    </p>

    <p>
        You must stay on task at all times. Otherwise you will automatically be disconnected and lose your bonus.
