        In this study, we’re exploring how people make cooperative decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In each of {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds, you’ll choose between two options: “Cooperative” or “Selfish”.
    </p>
    <p>
        The choices you make will affect your bonus as well as the bonus of a previous participant who participated in this study,
        as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Selfish option: You receive {{ C.endowment }}, while the previous participant receives £0.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cooperative option: You receive <u>fewer</u> than {{ C.endowment }},
                and the previous participant receives <u>more</u> than £0.
            </li>
        </ul>
        The exact amount you and the previous participant will receive,
        if you choose the cooperative option, will vary each round
    </p>
    <p>
        Only one round will be chosen to count toward the final bonus.
        This round will be selected at random after you have completed all rounds.
        Each round has an equal chance of being selected.
        Only amounts from the chosen round will be added to your and the previous participant’s bonus payments.

        In this study, we’re exploring how people make financial decisions involving risk.
    </p>

    <p>
        In each of {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds,
        you’ll choose between two options: a “risky” option” and a “sure thing”.
    </p>

    <p>
        The choices you make will affect your bonus as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Sure thing: You receive {{ C.endowment }}.
            </li>
            <li>
                Risky option: You have a chance of earning more than {{ C.endowment }}.
                But you also might earn nothing.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The exact amounts you might earn by selecting the risky option
        and the exact probability with which you might earn it will vary each round.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only one round will be chosen to count toward the final bonus.
        This round will be selected at random after you have completed all rounds.
        Each round has an equal chance of being selected.
        Only amounts from the chosen round will be added to your bonus.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you selected the risky option in that round
        we will then randomly determine whether you get the specified bonus based on the specified probability.
