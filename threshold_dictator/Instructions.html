        For this part, in each of {{ C.half_rounds }} rounds, you’ll choose between two options: “Cooperative” or “Selfish”.
    </p>
    <p>
        The choices you make will affect your bonus
        as well as the bonus of a previous participant who participated in this study,
        as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Selfish option: You receive {{ C.endowment }}, while the previous participant receives £0.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cooperative option: You receive <u>less</u> than {{ C.endowment }},
                and the previous participant receives <u>more</u> than £0.
            </li>
        </ul>
        The exact amount you and the previous participant will receive,
        if you choose the cooperative option, will vary each round
    </p>

        In each of {{ C.half_rounds }} rounds,
        you’ll choose between two options: a “risky” option and a “sure thing”.
    </p>

    <p>
        The choices you make will affect your bonus as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Sure thing: You receive {{ C.endowment }}.
            </li>
            <li>
                Risky option: You have a chance of earning more than {{ C.endowment }}.
                But you also might earn nothing.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The exact amounts you might earn by selecting the risky option
        and the exact probability with which you might earn it will vary each round.
        Only amounts from the chosen round will be added to your bonus.
