        <b>Thank you for taking part in this study!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this study, you will interact anonymously with others via the computer.
        You will be faced with a series of decision-making situations.
        The entire study will take approximately {{ C.session_time }} minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        For your participation in the study, you will earn {{ session.participation_fee }} for simply participating.
        In addition, you can earn an additional bonus, the amount of which will depend on your choices and the choices of other participants.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this study, there will be two different parts.
        In one part, we will be studying cooperative decision-making.
        In the other part, we will be studying financial decision-making.
        In each part you will make {{ C.half_rounds }} different choices.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the choices you make will be randomly selected at the end of the study to “count”;
        meaning, the choice you make in that round will influence the bonus you earn
        as well as potentially the bonus another participant earns.
    </p>
