        In this study, we’re exploring how people make cooperative decisions across a series of choices,
        with some conditions changing each time.
    </p>
    <p>
        In each of 20 rounds, you’ll choose between two options: “Cooperative” or “Selfish”.
    </p>
    <p>
        The choices you make will affect your bonus as well as the bonus of a previous participant who participated in this study,
        as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Selfish option: You receive 100 points, while the previous participant receives 0 points.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cooperative option: You receive fewer than 100 points,
                and the previous participant receives more than 0 points.
            </li>
        </ul>
        The exact points awarded will vary each round.
    </p>
    <p>
        These points will be converted to cents and added to your and the previous participant’s bonus payments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only one round will be chosen to count toward the final bonus.
        The chance of any given round being selected varies,
        ranging from 1% to 10%.
        Only points from the chosen round will be added to your and the previous participant’s bonus payments.
    </p>
    <p>
        On each decision screen, you’ll see all the relevant information for that round,
        including your points,
        and the previous participant’s points.

        In this study, we’re exploring how people make financial decisions involving risk.
    </p>

    <p>
        In each of 20 rounds, you’ll choose between two options: a “risky” option and a “sure thing”.
    </p>

    <p>
        The choices you make will affect your bonus as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Sure thing: You receive 100 cents.
            </li>
            <li>
                Risky option: You have a chance of earning more than 100 cents.
                But you also might earn nothing.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The exact number of cents you might earn by selecting the risky option
        and the exact probability with which you might earn it will vary each round.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only one round will be chosen to count toward the final bonus.
        This round will be selected at random after you have completed all rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you selected the risky option in that round
        we will then randomly determine whether you get the specified bonus based on the specified probability.
