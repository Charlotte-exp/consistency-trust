        <b>Thank you for taking part in this study!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this study, <b>you will interact anonymously with others</b> via the computer.
        You will be faced with a series of decision-making situations.
        The entire study will take approximately {{ C.session_time }} minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        For your participation in the study, you will earn {{ session.participation_fee }} for simply participating.
        In addition, <b>you can earn additional bonuses</b>,
        the amount of which will depend on your choices and the choices of other participants.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this study, there will be <b>two different parts</b>.
<!--        In one part, we will be studying cooperative decision-making.-->
<!--        In the other part, we will be studying financial decision-making.-->
<!--        In each part you will make C.half_rounds different choices.-->
        In both parts, we will be studying cooperative decision-making.
        You will make a total of 30 decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>One of the choices you make in each part will be randomly selected</b> at the end of the study to “count”;
        meaning, the choice you make in that round will influence the bonus you earn
        as well as potentially the bonus another participant earns.
