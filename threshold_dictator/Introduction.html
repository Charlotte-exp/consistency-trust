        <b>Thank you for taking part in this study!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        In this study, you will take part in two similar but separate tasks.
        Each task will run for {{ C.half_rounds }} rounds.
        Your bonus payment will depend on the decisions you make in those rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only one round will be chosen to count toward the final bonus.
        This round will be selected at random after you have completed all the rounds of both tasks.
        Each round has an equal chance of being selected.
        Only amounts from the chosen round will be added to your bonus.
    </p>

        When you press next, you will read the instructions of the first task.
