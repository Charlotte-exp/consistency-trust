        <b>Thank you for taking part in this study!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        In this study, there will be two different parts.
        In one part, we will be studying cooperative decision-making.
        In the other part, we will be studying financial decision-making.
        In each part you will make {{ C.half_rounds }} different choices.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the choices you make will be randomly selected at the end of the study to “count”;
        meaning, the choice you make in that round will influence the bonus you earn
        as well as potentially the bonus another participant earns.
    </p>
