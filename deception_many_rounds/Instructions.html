        This is a short experiment in decision-making.
        In this experiment you will be matched with another participant from Prolific.
        Neither of you will ever know the identity of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two players in this task: a <b>Sender</b> and a <b>Receiver</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment is made of <b>one task repeated several times</b>, each time with another participant.
        Your role, either Sender or Receiver, is fixed across all repeats of the task.
        The task is a choice between two bonus payment options: A and B.
        Each option determines a monetary bonus for both participants.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two possible sets of payment options.
        On each round you can face either of the two with 50% probability.
        At the end of the study, one task will be selected at random and you will be paid only the bonus from this task.
    </p>
    <p>
        The task is made of two steps:
        First, the Sender is informed of the bonuses attached to each option
        and then sends a message to the Receiver about these options.
        Second, the Receiver sees this message and chooses one of the two options.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Receiver makes the choice, but they do not know the bonuses attached to each options.
        The Sender does not make the choice, but they do know the bonuses attached to each options.

        <p>
            For all repetitions of the task, you have been assigned the role of: <b>{{ player.role }}</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            You are the one who knows what the bonuses from each option are.
            In the first step, you have a choice between two messages to send to the Receiver to influence their choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            The message you send can be either of:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Option A will earn you a bigger bonus that Option B.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Option B will earn you a bigger bonus that Option A.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            For the second step, one task will be chosen at random and your decision from that task will be implemented.
            The Receiver will see your message, and then choose either Option A or Option B.
            The message is not binding: in the end, it only depends on the Receiver's choice.
            Their decision will determine both of your bonuses,
            regardless of whether or not they followed your suggestion.
            However, <b>the Receiver will never know what bonuses were actually offered in the option not chosen</b>
            (that is, they will never know whether your message was true or not).
            Moreover, they will never know the bonuses that you could have earned according to the different options.
