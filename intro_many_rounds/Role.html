        <p>
            You have been assigned the role of: <b>Sender</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            You are the one who knows what the bonuses from each option are.
            <u>In the first stage</u>, you have a choice between two messages to send to the Receiver to influence their choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can see below how the choice will look like.
        </p>

<div class="card bg-light instructions">
    <div  class="card-body">
            <div class='frame' style="text-align:center">
                <img src="{{ static 'intro_many_rounds/options_1.png'}}" width="auto" height="120"/>
                <img src="{{ static 'intro_many_rounds/sender_message.png'}}" width="auto" height="180"/>
            </div>
    </div>
</div>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            You will make this choice many times over multiple rounds.
            <font color="red">The monetary values of each Option can change in each round, so pay attention.</font>
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>For the second stage</u>, one round will be chosen at random and your decision from that round will be implemented.
            The Receiver will see your message, and then choose either Option A or Option B.
            The message is not binding: in the end, it only depends on the Receiver's choice.
            Their decision will determine both of your bonuses,
            regardless of whether or not they followed your suggestion.
            However, <b>the Receiver will never know what bonuses were actually offered in the option not chosen</b>
            (that is, they will never know whether your message was true or not).
            Moreover, they will never know the bonuses that you could have earned according to the different options.
        </p>


<p></p>

    <p>
        After you press the "Next" button,
        you will immediately start with the first round of stage 1.
    </p>

        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-end">
        {% next_button %}
