        In this experiment you will be matched with another participant from Prolific.
        Neither of you will ever know the identity of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of you will be the <b>Sender</b> and the other the <b>Receiver</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment is made of two stages:
        The first stage is made of many rounds of the same task.
        In each round, the Sender learns about two bonus payment options: A and B.
        Each option determines a monetary bonus for both participants.
        With this information, the Sender sends a message about those options to the Receiver.
        There are two possible sets of bonus payment options.
        On each round, the Sender can face either one or the other and send the message accordingly.
    </p>

            <img src="{{ static 'intro_many_rounds/options_2.png'}}" width="auto" height="110"/>
        </div>
    <p>
        In the second stage, the Receiver receives the message from one randomly selected round.
        With only this information, the Receiver must choose between Option A and Option B.
        The bonus of both players is determined by the choice of the Receiver and which round was randomly selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Receiver makes the choice, but they do not know the bonuses attached to each options.
        The Sender does not make the choice, but they do know the bonuses attached to each options.
    </p>

<div class="card bg-light instructions">
    <div  class="card-body">
        <p>
            You have been assigned the role of: <b>Sender</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            You are the one who knows what the bonuses from each option are.
            In the first stage, you have a choice between two messages to send to the Receiver to influence their choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can see below exactly how to choice will look like.
        </p>
            <div class='frame' style="text-align:center">
                <img src="{{ static 'intro_many_rounds/sender_message.png'}}" width="auto" height="170"/>
            </div>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            You will make this choice many times over multiple rounds.
            The monetary values of each Option can change in each round, so pay attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the second stage, one round will be chosen at random and your decision from that round will be implemented.
            The Receiver will see your message, and then choose either Option A or Option B.
            The message is not binding: in the end, it only depends on the Receiver's choice.
            Their decision will determine both of your bonuses,
            regardless of whether or not they followed your suggestion.
            However, <b>the Receiver will never know what bonuses were actually offered in the option not chosen</b>
            (that is, they will never know whether your message was true or not).
            Moreover, they will never know the bonuses that you could have earned according to the different options.
