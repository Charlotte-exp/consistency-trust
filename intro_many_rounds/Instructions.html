        This is a short experiment in decision-making.
        In this experiment you will be matched with another participant from Prolific.
        Neither of you will ever know the identity of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are two players in this experiment: a <b>Sender</b> and a <b>Receiver</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment is made of two stages:
        The first stage is made of many rounds of the same task.
        In each, the Sender learns about two bonus payment options: A and B.
        Each option determines a monetary bonus for both participants.
        There are two possible sets of payment options.
        On each round the Sender can face either of the two with 50% probability.
        With this information, the Sender sends a message about those options to the Receiver.
        This action repeats on each round.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the last round, one round is selected at random
        and the message chosen in this round only is sent to the Receiver.
        The sender makes a repeated decision over many rounds.
        In the second stage, the Receiver receives this message and chooses between Option A and Option B.
        The message is the only information about the bonuses that the Receiver has.
        The bonus of both players is determined by the choice of the Receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Receiver makes the choice, but they do not know the bonuses attached to each options.
        The Sender does not make the choice, but they do know the bonuses attached to each options.
    </p>

<div class="card bg-light instructions">

            You have been assigned the role of: <b>{{ player.role }}</b>

        {{ if player.role == C.SENDER_ROLE }}
        <p>
            You are the one who knows what the bonuses from each option are.
            In the first stage, you have a choice between two messages to send to the Receiver to influence their choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can see below exactly how to choice will look like.

        <p>
            You will make this choice many times over multiple rounds.
            The monetary values of each Option can change in each round, so pay attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the second stage, one round will be chosen at random and your decision from that round will be implemented.
            The Receiver will see your message, and then choose either Option A or Option B.
            The message is not binding: in the end, it only depends on the Receiver's choice.
            Their decision will determine both of your bonuses,
            regardless of whether or not they followed your suggestion.
            However, <b>the Receiver will never know what bonuses were actually offered in the option not chosen</b>
            (that is, they will never know whether your message was true or not).
            Moreover, they will never know the bonuses that you could have earned according to the different options.
        </p>
        <p>
            After you press the "Next" button,
            you will immediately start with the first round of stage 1.

        {{ else }}
        <p>
            You are the one who receives the message and chooses the Option.
            In the first stage, you must simply wait to be matched with a Sender that has finished stage 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            The message you receive can be either of:

            The message is not binding: in the end, it only depends on the Receiver's choice.

            After you press the "Next" button,
            you will be redirected to a wait room to be paired with the first available Sender.
