        In this experiment you will be matched with another participant from Prolific.
        Neither of you will ever know the identity of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of you will be the <b>Sender</b> and the other the <b>Receiver</b>.
    </p>

    <p></p>

    <p>
        <h5>The experiment is made of <b>two stages:</b></h5>
    <u>The first stage</u> is made of many rounds of the same task.
        In each round, the Sender learns about two bonus payment options: A and B.
        Each option determines a monetary bonus for both participants,
        which will be paid to you in addition to the participation payment.
        With this information, the Sender sends a message about those options to the Receiver.
        There are two possible sets of bonus payment options.
        On each round, the Sender can face either one or the other and send the message accordingly.

    <p>
        <u>In the second stage</u>, the Receiver receives the message from one randomly selected round.
        With only this information, the Receiver must choose between Option A and Option B.
        The bonus of both players is determined by the choice of the Receiver and which round was randomly selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Receiver makes the choice, but they do not know the bonuses attached to each options.
        The Sender does not make the choice, but they do know the bonuses attached to each options.
