    <p>
        Unlike the Receiver, the Sender knows what the options are.
        The Sender must choose which message to send.<br>
        The two possible messages look like this:
    </p>
</div>

<div class="card bg-light instructions">
    <div  class="card-body">
        <p style="text-align:center">
            Which message would you like to send to the Receiver?
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col" style="text-align:center">
                <button name="message_test" value="Option A" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">Option A will earn the Receiver a bigger bonus than Option B</button>
            </div>
            <div class="col" style="text-align:center">
                <button name="message_test" value="Option B" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">Option B will earn the Receiver a bigger bonus than Option A</button>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            <i>You can click on a message to see what it feels like.</i>
        </p>

<div>
    <p>
        Remember, the message is the only information the Receiver has about the bonuses.
        Regardless of what the message say, they can choose any option.
        Once they choice is made, they will only know their own bonus.
        They will never know what the Sender earned or what was in the option not chosen.
